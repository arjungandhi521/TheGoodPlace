# The Good Place Formula

Have you ever wondered where you are going after you die? Now you can know with 100% certainty. This is a program inspired by NBC's "The Good Place". In its first episode, we learn many of the things that help determine if you end up in eternal paradise (the Good Place) or with infinite torture (the Bad Place). I used these figures to create a Java program that calculates my moral value. All of these actions that determine where you go can be found in the link in the Acknowledgments. All the code is in "Main.java" and its output is in "output".
